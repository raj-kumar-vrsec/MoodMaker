## Project Overview
The **Daily Mood Tracker** is a visually appealing and interactive web application that allows users to select and track their daily moods.

- **Mood History**: The last five selected moods are stored and displayed.
- **Dark Mode**: Users can switch between light and dark themes.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions enhance user interaction.
